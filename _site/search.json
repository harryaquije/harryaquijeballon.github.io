    "section": "",
    "text": "Quality of service (QoS) in mobile connectivity has significantly improved over the last decade. Ensuring that consumers enjoy a good quality of network service is a priority for both telecoms operators and policymakers. For operators, QoS is a key differentiator in competitive markets. Regulations around QoS have been evolving for the last decade, with notable developments in recent years.\nThere has been an increasing regulation tendency over the years. At the end of 2022, 75% of countries had QoS regulation on mobile broadband. Using data from the World Bank Income Classification we found a negative correlation between the income level of a country and the introduction of QoS regulations. In general, richer countries tend to have less QoS regulations over the last ten years.\n\n\nMobile QoS regulations by Income Level, 2014-2024\n\n\n\n\nSource: Authors’ analysis based on ITU and WB data\n\n\n\nWe empirically analysed the main drivers of QoS improvements in mobile communications for a global panel of 187 countries in the 2011-2023 period. Our models compile some of the most common QoS metrics for mobile broadband (such as download and upload speed, and latency), our independent variables are spectrum, technology generation and devices, national ICT infrastructure, other types of regulation, plus an extensive set of controls. Our empirical strategy consists in linear panel data models using the two-way fixed-effects (TWFE) estimator.\nWe evaluate the impact of the introduction of regulation on QoS performance, using a binary treatment variable obtained from ITU with covering most countries in the world from 2011 to 2022. We use novel difference-in-difference techniques including Sun and Abraham (2021), Borusyak et al. (2024), and the De Chaisemartin and d’Haultfoeuille (2020). The results indicate that there is no statistically significant effect at any period after the introduction of regulation.\n\n\nEffect of the introduction of QoS regulation on download speeds\n\n\n\n\nSource: Authors’ analysis\n\n\n\nWe find that competitive markets have been crucial to improvements in mobile QoS over the past decade. In contrast, we do not find significant evidence that introducing QoS obligations alone has improved outcomes. Moreover, mobile QoS improvements over the period were largely explained by:\n\n⚡ Adoption of new mobile technology generations (4G and 5G, in particular)\n\n📱 Better devices and smartphones\n\n📶 Increase in available spectrum to roll out each technology\n\n🌐️ Expansion of fibre network footprint in the country\n\n\n📄 Read the working paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "title": "Beyond financial inclusion: Does mobile money drive GDP growth?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Mobile money has become a mainstream financial service across many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Especially in countries where a large proportion of the population is either unbanked or underserved by traditional financial institutions. In 2021, one third of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa had a mobile money account and in 11 African countries, more adults had a mobile money account than had a financial institution account. The Covid-19 pandemic also led to a significant expansion of mobile money services, as people switched from cash to digital payments during periods of social distancing.\n\n\nCounties with mobile money deployments in the 2013-2022 period\n\n\n\n\nSource: GSMA Global Adoption Survey on Mobile Money 2022\n\n\n\nBy leveraging a unique dataset that measures mobile money adoption and usage across 133 countries over a 10-year period between 2013 and 2022, we find that mobile money had a significant impact on GDP growth. On average, a 10 percentage point increase in mobile money adoption increased GDP by 0.4–1%. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the impact is enhanced with more sophisticated and intense usage of different mobile money products, particularly those other than P2P, cash-in and cash-out, and that network effects play an important role.\nBased on predictions from our econometric specification, we find that at the end of 2022, mobile money contributed almost $600 billion (1.5%) to GDP in low- and middle-income countries. Given the extensive empirical literature that has demonstrated the microeconomic impacts of mobile money, particularly in terms of risk coping and consumption smoothing, our findings show that if adoption is high enough, these micro-effects also have an impact at the macro-level, thereby lifting upwards the trajectory of long-term economic growth.\n\n\nSimulated impact of mobile money on GDP in mobile money countries, 2013-2022\n\n\n\n\nSource: GSMA Intelligence\n\n\n\nDigital financial inclusion can drive long-term GDP growth, just as traditional financial services have been shown to do. There are still 1.4 billion adults worldwide, or almost one quarter of the adult population, who are unbanked. Moreover, it is also important not just increasing mobile money adoption but also the development of a strong digital financial ecosystem and greater financial deepening. Our results provide further evidence of the link between enabling regulation and mobile money adoption, which has been shown in previous studies. Lastly, the findings highlight the importance of tackling the usage and coverage gaps. Mobile money is only accessible if individuals can access and use a mobile device, while mobile internet can offer a broader range of financial products and services than basic mobile access.\n\n📄 Read the study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "A Tale of Two Cities",
    "text": "A Tale of Two Cities\nHaving lived in London for the last four years, one of the things I appreciate most is the abundance of parks and green spaces. London consistently ranks among the top five cities globally for green coverage, depending on the methodology used. City planners around the world face the challenge of balancing productive and recreational land use — a balance that profoundly shapes the quality of urban life.\nThroughout human history, our close relationship with nature has made access to green areas an essential component of modern living. These spaces provide environmental benefits such as improved air quality, social value through shared community spaces, and significant mental health benefits. Research also suggests that exposure to nature can enhance creativity and productivity. Green areas are not just leisure amenities — they are vital for sustainable, resilient, and liveable cities, playing a crucial role in mitigating the effects of climate change.\nThis project quantifies and maps green areas in London and Lima using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. The goal is to estimate the total share of green areas and their distribution within each city as a proxy for inclusivity and accessibility. Both capitals share similarities in population size and area (Table 1), yet differ substantially in infrastructure, planning, and income levels — though these socioeconomic factors are beyond the focus of this study.\n\nTable 1: Demographic Comparison\n\n\n\nDimension\nGreater London\nMetropolitan Lima\n\n\n\n\nArea\n1,573 km²\n2,819 km²\n\n\nPopulation (2025)\n9.8 million\n11.5 million\n\n\nGDP per capita, PPP (2024)\n$60,620\n$17,802\n\n\n\n Notes: The GDP per capita (PPP, current international $) figures correspond to the United Kingdom for Greater London and Peru for Metropolitan Lima.\nSource: World Bank (2024); World Population Review (2025)."

For London, these polygons were combined with Natural England’s Green Belt data — a designated zone of open, undeveloped land encircling London, designed to limit urban sprawl and preserve open countryside.\nEach dataset was spatially clipped to the official city boundaries: Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) for London, obtained from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and administrative districts (distritos) for Lima, from Peru’s National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI). The analysis then computed the share of total green area as a percentage of each unit’s total land area using spatial intersection and area-weighted aggregation."

This figure aligns with findings from Greenspace Information for Greater London (GiGL), which estimates that 33% of London’s area consists of natural habitats and an additional 14% is domestic garden space making a total of 47%. Despite this, access is not uniform — leafy boroughs in the southwest contrast sharply with denser urban areas where public green space is limited.\nIn comparison, Metropolitan Lima’s total green area share is 11.3%, covering about 317 km². The spatial distribution of green areas is uneven: substantial parks and vegetated zones are concentrated in the south and some parts of the north, while much of the east — and large portions of the densely populated northern districts — show limited access to such spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Map data from OpenStreetMap, ONS, INEI\n\n\n\nKey Insights\n\nEquity of access matters as much as total coverage.

Policymakers could focus on enhancing micro-green spaces, improving green corridors, and ensuring that new developments incorporate accessible public green areas.\nFor Lima, the challenge is more foundational: expanding green coverage, prioritising green infrastructure in urban planning, and promoting community-led initiatives to revitalise degraded public spaces.

    "text": "Every decision matters\nEvery day we face decisions about small things and events that can change our lives. How to make the right choice can be explained by self-interest or as stated by the rational model of economics, consumers seek to maximize preferences.\nAs we interact in society, we want to compare preferences across individuals and establish rankings. This can serve different purposes, from a marketing point of view, predicting people’s choices allows the design of products matching those preferences and that are more appealing to customers. For policymakers understanding individual preferences allows the design of policies that bring greater value across the population.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the science to teach machines human-like abilities and with the launch of ChatGPT and similar models — in the last few years — anyone with access to the internet can benefit from it. If used correctly AI can boost productivity and lead to economic progress like never before; however, the risks match the potential gains. As machines become more powerful it can be a risk that they will surpass us.\nThe focus has been on large language models that can create human-like content. Originally, researchers trained these models to do specific tasks. For example, face recognition or playing Go. This is known as narrow AI, and on this topic, AI systems have outperformed the best humans. As happened in March 2016 when AlphaGo from DeepMind defeated a world champion, a decade before experts thought possible."

This evolution could potentially reach what is known as artificial general intelligence, that is the state in which machines can do all human activities. It is someone you can talk to and can do anything, not just one specific thing. We are not there yet, but in this process, machines will face decisions just as we do.\nAI expert Stuart Russel in his book Human Compatible AI and the Problem of Control addresses this problem. He proposes that AI researchers, in thinking about how to create beneficial AI, must follow three principles.\n\nThe machine’s only objective is to maximize the realization of human preferences.\n\nThe machine is initially uncertain about what those preferences are.\n\nThe ultimate source of information about human preferences is human behavior.\n\nHuman preferences are the foundation for these principles, which takes us back to the individuals’ choice process adding the complexity that machines should learn to understand us. They should do this based on the observation of our choices, as we do with the rest of the world. Then, they go back to the first principle."

In this second instalment, I turn to two very different cities: Seville, Spain, and Arequipa, Peru.\nAt first glance, both cities appear relatively “green” when viewed from above. Yet a closer look reveals a crucial distinction: not all green space is green space for people.

However, once agricultural land is separated from recreational green space, a very different picture emerges.\n\nTable 2: Composition of green areas in Arequipa metropolitan area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of green area\nArea (km²)\nShare of total green\nShare of city area\n\n\n\n\nAgricultural green\n59\n85%\n8.7%\n\n\nUrban green (parks & recreation)\n10\n15%\n1.5%\n\n\n\n Source: Author’s analysis based on OSM and INEI \n\nIn total, green areas account for about 10% of Arequipa Metropolitan’s land area. Yet only 1.5% of the city consists of parks and recreational green spaces.\nThe vast majority of green land is agricultural — concentrated along the city’s periphery and river valleys — and is largely inaccessible to residents for daily recreation.\nThis distinction is critical. From a satellite or statistical perspective, Arequipa may appear moderately green. From the perspective of a resident seeking shade, leisure, or respite from heat, the city is far less so.\nTo make this distinction visible, the analysis produces a single map for Arequipa with three elements:\n\nMetropolitan boundary (white outline)\nAgricultural green (light green)\nUrban green spaces (dark green)\n\nWe can see that green clusters are not where most people live — and not where they can relax. By contrast, Seville’s map shows green areas distributed as functional urban infrastructure rather than residual land.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Map data from OpenStreetMap, ONS, INEI\n\n\n\nKey Insights\n\nGreen coverage alone is a misleading metric. Counting hectares without distinguishing land use overstates access in cities where agriculture dominates.\nArequipa’s green space is productive, not recreational. Agricultural land plays an important economic and environmental role — but it does not substitute for parks.\nUrban form matters. Seville’s green spaces are embedded within neighbourhoods; Arequipa’s are largely peripheral.\nHeat and climate risks amplify the problem. In hot, high-altitude cities like Arequipa, the absence of accessible green areas has direct implications for health and liveability.\n\n\n\nPolicy Implications\nThe policy takeaway is not that agricultural land should be replaced — quite the opposite.\nFor Arequipa\n\nProtect agricultural green areas as environmental and cultural assets\nExplicitly plan for recreational green space, especially in dense districts\nPrioritise pocket parks, shaded corridors, river-adjacent public greenways\n\nFor Seville\n\nMaintain investment in public green infrastructure\nFocus on connectivity between green spaces\nPromote equitable access across neighbourhoods\nPrioritise heat-resilient urban design as temperature rise\n\n\n\nConclusion\nSeville and Arequipa illustrate a fundamental lesson in urban planning: Green space is not just about land cover, it is about access, purpose, and people. Cities can appear green while remaining inhospitable to daily life. Measuring and mapping green areas with attention to how they are used reveals a more honest picture and a clearer path for policy.\nIn the end, the relevant question is not “How green is your city?” It is: “How green is your city for the people who live there?”\n\n\nInteractive Maps\n\nInteractive map for Seville\nThe interactive map below displays the share of green areas in the Seville municipality.

    "title": "From Physical to Digital Things: What does IoT mean for economic growth?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "While mobile technologies have already connected billions of people, the Internet of Things (IoT) is now adding all kinds of devices to the digital ecosystem. The potential benefits of connecting the physical world to the internet are vast, but not well understood, and with increasing adoption and use cases there is a need to better understand the potential economic impacts these could enable.\nIoT is about connecting everything to the internet -with applications for consumers and businesses- across all economic sectors. According to GSMA Intelligence, at the end of 2023 there were 21 billion IoT connections. These are expected to almost double by 2030. By connecting the physical world to the internet, IoT can impact economic growth through similar channels that ICTs benefit households and industries. That is in the form of spillovers leading to greater productivity, a more efficient allocation of resources, and new opportunities for innovation.\n\n\nIoT connections per capita in 2022\n\n\n\n\nSource: GSMA Intelligence\n\n\n\nThis study provides a contribution to quantify the contribution of IoT to economic growth. By leveraging a unique dataset that measures IoT connections by vertical industry across 163 countries between 2010 and 2022, we find that IoT made a significant contribution to GDP growth.\nOn average, a 10 percentage point increase in IoT connections per inhabitant increased GDP by 0.7% in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) and 0.5% in high-income countries (HICs). We find that this impact is primarily driven by enterprise IoT, accounting for 80% of the total effect, while consumer IoT contributed 20%.\nThese results have important implications for policymakers. Enterprise IoT has gained momentum in recent years and by 2030, more than 60% of total connections will be enterprise IoT connections. Governments can implement policies to stimulate IoT adoption by businesses, which will enhance competitiveness and benefit the wider economy. Moreover, some industries were found to drive larger economic benefits, for example manufacturing, financial and insurance activities and the services sector.\n\n\nIoT connections per capita, by verticals in the 2010-2022, period\n\n\n\n\nSource: GSMA Intelligence\n\n\n\nOne of the key components that will support the development of IoT use cases across industries is a better and more reliable connectivity. In this context, 5G can unlock the IoT benefits not available with 4G or previous mobile generations, these can be grouped under three main categories: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive IoT (known as mMTC), and critical communications.\nWe assume that IoT contributes to the economy in the form of productivity spillovers, similar to the more traditional ICTs, but the effects of IoT can be different especially considering the rapid advancement of new technologies, and the interaction of IoT with AI, cloud computing, and edge computing, giving the possibility to introduce changes in the economy not seen before.\n\n📄 Read the paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
