London consistently ranks among the top five cities globally for green coverage, depending on the methodology used. City planners around the world face the challenge of balancing productive and recreational land use — a balance that profoundly shapes the quality of urban life.\n\nThroughout human history, our close relationship with nature has made access to green areas an essential component of modern living. These spaces provide environmental benefits such as improved air quality, social value through shared community spaces, and significant mental health benefits. Research also suggests that exposure to nature can enhance creativity and productivity. Green areas are not just leisure amenities — they are vital for sustainable, resilient, and liveable cities, playing a crucial role in mitigating the effects of climate change.\n\nThis project quantifies and maps green areas in London and Lima using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. The goal is to estimate the total share of green areas and their distribution within each city as a proxy for inclusivity and accessibility. Both capitals share similarities in population size and area (Table 1), yet differ substantially in infrastructure, planning, and income levels — though these socioeconomic factors are beyond the focus of this study.\n\n::: {.table-captioned}\n*Table 1: Demographic Comparison*\n\n| Dimension                  | Greater London | Metropolitan Lima |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Area                       | 1,573 km²      | 2,819 km²         |\n| Population (2025)           | 9.8 million    | 11.5 million      |\n| GDP per capita, PPP (2024)  | $60,620        | $17,802           |\n\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">\nNotes: The GDP per capita (PPP, current international $) figures correspond to the United Kingdom for Greater London and Peru for Metropolitan Lima.  \nSource: World Bank (2024); World Population Review (2025).\n</span>\n:::\n\n## Data and Methodology\n\nTo calculate the share of green space, OpenStreetMap (OSM) data was used to extract green area polygons for both cities. For London, these polygons were combined with Natural England’s Green Belt data — a designated zone of open, undeveloped land encircling London, designed to limit urban sprawl and preserve open countryside.\n\nEach dataset was spatially clipped to the official city boundaries: Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) for London, obtained from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and administrative districts (distritos) for Lima, from Peru’s National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI). The analysis then computed the share of total green area as a percentage of each unit’s total land area using spatial intersection and area-weighted aggregation.\n\n## Results\n\nThe analysis finds that Greater London’s green area share is approximately **33.6%**, equivalent to 529 km² of land. This figure aligns with findings from Greenspace Information for Greater London (GiGL), which estimates that 33% of London’s area consists of natural habitats and an additional 14% is domestic garden space making a total of 47%. Despite this, access is not uniform — leafy boroughs in the southwest contrast sharply with denser urban areas where public green space is limited.\n\nIn comparison, Metropolitan Lima’s total green area share is **11.3%**, covering about 317 km². The spatial distribution of green areas is uneven: substantial parks and vegetated zones are concentrated in the south and some parts of the north, while much of the east — and large portions of the densely populated northern districts — show limited access to such spaces.\n\n<div class=\"talk-figure\">\n  <div class=\"figure-title\"></div>\n  \n  ![Source: Map data from OpenStreetMap, ONS, INEI](glondon_lima_v1.png){.talk-image}\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **Equity of access matters as much as total coverage.** While London’s 33.6% green share appears high, some boroughs still experience shortages in accessible public green space, often correlating with higher population density and lower income levels.\n2. **Urban planning legacies shape outcomes.** London’s protected Green Belt has been instrumental in preserving open land, but it also limits housing supply within the city, pushing development outward. Lima, on the other hand, has expanded rapidly with minimal zoning restrictions, resulting in fragmented and uneven green coverage.\n3. **Socioeconomic disparities are visible on the map.** In Lima, green areas tend to cluster around higher-income neighbourhoods and tourist zones, highlighting inequalities in urban amenities.\n4. **Climate adaptation potential.** Expanding and maintaining urban green areas can help mitigate heat stress, improve air quality, and enhance biodiversity — benefits particularly relevant to Lima’s arid coastal environment.\n\n## Conclusions and Policy Recommendations\n\nThis comparative analysis underscores that both cities, despite their differences, face ongoing challenges in ensuring equitable access to nature within dense urban environments.\n\nFor London, maintaining and improving accessibility should remain a priority. Policymakers could focus on enhancing micro-green spaces, improving green corridors, and ensuring that new developments incorporate accessible public green areas.\n\nFor Lima, the challenge is more foundational: expanding green coverage, prioritising green infrastructure in urban planning, and promoting community-led initiatives to revitalise degraded public spaces. Integrating green design into housing and transport projects would also contribute to a more sustainable and liveable city.\n\nGreen spaces are essential urban infrastructure — not luxuries. They improve health, foster social connection, and build resilience to climate change. Whether in London, Lima, or elsewhere, increasing equitable access to green areas should be central to the vision of every modern city.\n\n## Interactive Maps\n\nBeyond the numbers, visualising the spatial distribution of green spaces reveals the story more powerfully.   While Greater London benefits from a wide network of parks, woodlands, and the surrounding Green Belt, Lima’s pattern highlights the urban and social challenges of providing equitable access to nature in a rapidly expanding metropolis.  \n\nThe interactive maps below allow readers to explore these differences directly, zoom into neighbourhoods, compare patterns, and reflect on how green space accessibility shapes the liveability of each city.\n\n### Interactive map for Greater London\n\nThe interactive map below displays the share of green areas across neighbourhoods (Lower Layer Super Output Areas – LSOAs) in Greater London.  \nUsers can explore how access to green spaces varies spatially, from the central urban core to the surrounding areas covered by the Green Belt.\n\n<iframe src=\"london_green_share_lsoa.html\"\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"650px\"\n        style=\"border:none;\"\n        title=\"Interactive map of green area share by LSOA in Greater London\">\n</iframe>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:0.9em;\">\n*Source: OpenStreetMap, ONS, Natural England (Green Belt).
